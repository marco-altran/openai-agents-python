# OpenAI Agents PHP Port - Phase 1 Summary

## Completed Components

### Core Classes
- ✅ Agent - Main class for defining an LLM-powered agent
- ✅ ModelSettings - Configuration for model parameters
- ✅ Tool & FunctionTool - Interface and implementation for agent tools
- ✅ Result - Class for representing agent execution results
- ✅ Runner - Class for executing agents with sync/async support

### Model Integration
- ✅ ModelInterface - Abstract interface for language models
- ✅ OpenAIModel - Implementation for the OpenAI ChatCompletions API
- ✅ FakeModel - Test implementation for unit/integration tests

### Testing
- ✅ Unit tests for all core components
- ✅ Integration tests for the complete agent execution flow
- ✅ Tests for both basic conversations and tool usage

## Features Implemented
- ✅ Agent creation with instructions and tools
- ✅ Function-based tools with automatic JSON Schema generation
- ✅ Tool execution and response handling
- ✅ Basic agent-to-agent handoff structure
- ✅ Synchronous execution with the Runner
- ✅ Token usage tracking
- ✅ Error handling for invalid inputs

## PHP 8.1+ Features Used
- ✅ Constructor property promotion
- ✅ Named arguments
- ✅ Union types
- ✅ Readonly properties
- ✅ Match expressions
- ✅ Return type declarations
- ✅ Nullable types

## Next Steps for Phase 2

1. **Enhance Function Schema Generation**
   - Support for more complex types
   - Better PHPDoc parsing for parameters
   - Attribute-based schema annotations

2. **Tool Decorator**
   - Create PHP attribute for decorating functions as tools
   - Support for registering callable arrays automatically

3. **Structured Output**
   - Support for JSON validation of structured outputs
   - Type mapping between JSON Schema and PHP types

4. **Enhanced Testing**
   - Tests for asynchronous execution
   - Tests for complex tool interactions
   - Performance benchmarks

## Test Results
All 35 tests are passing, covering both unit and integration tests.

## Usage Example
```php
// Create a function tool
$weatherTool = new FunctionTool(function(string $city): string {
    return "The weather in {$city} is sunny.";
}, 'getWeather');

// Create an agent with the tool
$agent = new Agent(
    name: "Weather Assistant",
    instructions: "You are a weather assistant",
    tools: [$weatherTool]
);

// Run the agent
$result = Runner::runSync($agent, "What's the weather in Tokyo?");
echo $result->getFinalOutputAsString();
```
